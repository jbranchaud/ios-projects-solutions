# Palindrome

> Checks if the string entered by the user is a palindrome. That is that it
> reads the same forwards as backwards like “racecar”

The solution to this project is a single view app with some descriptive
UILabels, a UITextField for entering a potential palindrome, a UIButton to
have the input checked, and a final UILabel to tell the user whether or not
it is a palindrome.
