# Reverse String

> Enter a string and the program will reverse it and print it out.

The solution to this problem involves a single-view application with a text
field, a button, and a label. Text can be entered into the text field. When
the button is pressed, the text that is currently in the text field will be
reversed and then assigned as the text of the label.
